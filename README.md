**Rochester Hometown Website**

This is a simple personal project I created to learn and practice HTML and CSS. The site highlights my hometown—Rochester, NY—and showcases local features using basic web design techniques.

_Purpose_

This project was built as a hands-on way to:

Learn  HTML
Practice CSS styling and layout
Understand how to structure a simple static site
