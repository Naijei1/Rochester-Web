# Rochester Hometown Website

This is a simple personal project I created to learn and practice HTML and CSS. The site highlights my hometown—Rochester, NY—and showcases local features using basic web design techniques.

## Purpose

This project was built as a hands-on way to:

- Learn  HTML
- Practice CSS styling and layout
- Understand how to structure a simple static site
